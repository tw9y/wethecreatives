I got a chance to talk to Viget - a web design and development company with 30+ employees that has been going strong since 1999. They have been working with start-ups, established brands, and non-profits to define, plan, design, build, and market remarkable web sites and digital products. To use their own words, they "build web business". Let's hear what they have to say and have a look at their office.

Give us some background about your company. What do you do and why are you that good at it?

>We design, build, and market digital products for startups, big brands, non-profits, and higher ed. Think [Bypass](http://bypasslane.com/ "visit bypasslane.com"), [Puma](http://www.puma.com/sailing "visit puma.com/sailing"), [STEM-Works](http://www.stem-works.com/ "visit stem-works.com"), and [Lafayette](http://www.lafayette.edu/ "visit lafayette.edu") as of late. We take great pride in being able to go end-to-end, strategy to launch to post-launch, with true expertise at every phase. We've built our reputation on depth of knowledge combined with a no-nonsense, flexible, high-impact approach. In our projects, if we've achieved a strong emotional response combined with an awesome user experience combined with measurable results on the client side, we're psyched. It's simple, but we always try to remember that we're designing for people (users/clients) more than we're designing for the web. [We're 11 years into](http://www.viget.com/blog/vigets-11th-birthday/ "visit viget blog post") this now, and every year [our work](http://www.viget.com/work/ "visit www.viget.com/work/") gets better, our [labs](http://www.viget.com/advance/ "visit www.viget.com/advance/") [go](http://www.viget.com/extend/ "visit www.viget.com/extend/") [deeper](http://www.viget.com/engage/ "visit www.viget.com/engage/"), and our love for community grows. We learn a lot and we give a lot -- it's all quite fun and rewarding.

What do you do to encourage creativity among employees?

>For our daily work, it boils down to us encouraging the stuff that encourages creativity: curiosity, exploration, collaboration, and risk taking. Whiteboards are everywhere, and everyone's on laptops so they can move around whenever they want. Outside of day-to-day routines, we try to set aside time every week for each employee to read and research, write and share, sketch and create -- basically expand their creativity on their own terms. Once a quarter, we all take an afternoon off and do something fun together like [kayaking](http://www.flickr.com/photos/viget/sets/72157621574668318/ "visit kayaking gallery"), [paintball](http://www.flickr.com/photos/viget/sets/72157625207959226/ "visit paintball gallery"), or [a cooking class](http://www.flickr.com/photos/viget/sets/72157624432868605/ "visit cooking class gallery"). We also like to combine creativity with community, often sharing our experiments via a [blog post](http://www.viget.com/inspire/39-ridiculous-things-to-do-with-css3-box-shadows/ "visit blog post"), [git repository](https://github.com/vigetlabs "visit viget git repository"), or [community event](http://www.viget.com/blog/refresh-regeneration/ "visit viget blog post"). And we love working on [Pointless Corp](http://www.pointlesscorp.com/ "visit pointless corp"). projects.

What do you like the most about your offices?

>First and foremost we like the locations. We always had a vision of multiple offices, each small enough to still feel like a family, each in a place with a unique style. Falls Church, VA; Durham, NC; and Boulder, CO, fit the bill nicely, providing the variety and lifestyle options we were looking for. Inside the doors, we take a certain level of pride in our spaces being touchable, non-intimidating, fun, and a bit no-nonsense. We have a few simple interior trademarks like garage doors to our conference rooms and employee-made collages on the walls, but we stay pretty down-to-earth and have no problem getting our Ikea on. Wii, ping-pong, foosball, [push-up club](http://www.viget.com/blog/viget-pushup-club-dominates-life/ "visit viget blog post"), and a vintage sit-down Ms. Pac-Man game (given to us by [Seth Godin](http://www.sethgodin.com/sg/ "visit seth godin")) keep us nice and loose when we need a break.

Let's have a look at the good stuff!
