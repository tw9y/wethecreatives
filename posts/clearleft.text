Today we had a chat with the digital product design company Clearleft about their office and what they do to encourage creativity amongst their employees.

Give us some background about your company. What do you do and why are you that good at it?

>Clearleft is a world-class team of designers and creative technologists. We’ve made it our goal to advance the field of user experience through our writing, conferences and the quality of our work. This is why we’ve gained a reputation as one of the most experienced UX consultancies working today.

What do you do to encourage creativity among employees?

>The key to creativity is autonomy, so we hire the best people, empower them to take control of their projects and give them a safe and nurturing environment in which to work. Rather than having a rigid methodology, we allow our team to use whatever tools, techniques and processes they need in order to get the work done.
>
Rather than jumping straight into solutions mode, we allow our teams the opportunity to explore the problem space and iterate through multiple ideas before settling in on the most promising solution. We do this through design research, collaborative workshops, product prototyping and lots and lots of sketching and sticky notes. 

What do you like the most about your office? 

>The office is light, open and airy allowing plenty of space to think. The walls are invariably covered in sketches which gives the studio a dynamic and lively feel. We've got a great meeting space downstairs, which is perfect for all the workshops we run. It's also a great venue for our public "skillswap" lectures and our regular company movie nights.
>
However the thing I like the most is our location, right in the heart of Brighton's trendy North Laine. This means that our office is constantly abuzz with friends, colleagues and clients dropping in to visit, to collaborate or just to borrow a desk and some wifi for the afternoon.

Let's have a look.
